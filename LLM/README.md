# LLM-Practice-Repo

> A collection of my hands-on exercises and experiments with various large language model (LLM) techniques. Each folder will eventually contain code and notes as I work through topics like LoRA fine-tuning, vLLM, and SGlang and so on.

---

## Repository Structure

- **lora/**  
  Placeholder for LoRA fine-tuning experiments and related scripts.

- **vllm/**  
  Placeholder for vLLM inference tests, benchmarks, and performance comparisons.

- **sglang/**  
  Placeholder for SGlang practice, example scripts, and documentation.

- **docs/**  
  Notes, resources, and high-level references for LLM concepts.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central place to track my progress and store example code while I explore different LLM-related techniques. As I fill in each folder, Iâ€™ll add step-by-step guides, configuration files, and sample data to demonstrate how to implement and test each method.
